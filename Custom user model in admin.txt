step1)
Create model based on existing model
why we do it becasue if we want some addintional inputs from the user while signing in 
like asking for phone.no. country code address etc we can do it using the custom user model. and not by default one

core python
setattr(object,"variable that value is stored",NEW-value)

class MAN:
	name="koshi"

obj=MAN.name
 it gonna print 
"koshi"

but if i want to change it then 

setattr(obj,'name',"koshish dave")
now it gonna print
koshish dave
