Django cors Header
needed when sending lots of requests to postman and stuff.

4) create app in django 
   django-admin startapp {appname}

in our app we have a category app 
in which we gonna use this
1)create model
2)register in admin
3)serializer.py file to serialize data in json (so that we can give to react.js)
4)views to get all category
5)setup url

1)CREATE MODEL
==>create class 
create varibale = models.charfield(max_lenth=50)

2)in the api folder we have created the category and in the catergory there is apps.py file(api/catogory/apps.py)
in which we have to register the category app

like this.

from django.apps import AppConfig

class CategoryConfig(AppConfig):
    name ='api.category'

then this has to be add in the installed apps
['api.category']

3)serializer : 
will import serializer from django.rest.framework
and add name , and description as varibale inside the class

from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Category

#serializer.py file to serialize data in JSON
class CategorySerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Category
        field = ('name','description')


4) view to get all category
#this view set it to show or push all the categoryies we have in the model
